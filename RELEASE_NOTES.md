# Release Notes

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.3

### Highlights
* Add functionality to create and play XO games

### libsplinter
* Add EventHistory trait to EventDealer to allow for new event subscribers to catch
  up on previous events. This trait describes how events are stored.
* Add LocalEventHistory, a basic implementation of EventHistory that stores events
  locally in a queue.
* Add MessageWrapper to be consumed by EventDealerWebsockets, to allow for
  shutdown messages to be sent by the EventDealer
* Enforce that a Splinter service may only be added to Splinter state if the
  connecting node is in its list of allowed nodes
* Add Context object for WebSocket callbacks to assist in restarting WebSocket
  connections
* Add specified supported service types to the service orchestrator to determine
  which service types are locally supported versus externally supported
* Only allow initialization of the orchestratorâ€™s supported service
* On restart, reuse the services of circuits which are stored locally
* Add circuit ID when creating a service factory, in case it is needed by the
  service
* Replace UUID with service_id::circuit_id, which is guaranteed to be unique on
  a Splinter node, to name the Scabbard database
* Fix clippy error in events reactor
* Fix tests to match updated cargo args format
* Change certain circuit fields from strings to enums
* Remove Splinter client from CLI to decrease build time

### Gameroom Example
* Add ability in the UI to fetch and list XO games
* Correct arguments used to fetch the members of an existing gameroom, allowing
  the members to be included in the /gamerooms endpoint response
* Add GET /keys/{public_key} endpoint to gameroomd, to fetch key information
  associated with a public key
* Add UI functionality to create a new XO game:
* Add ability to calculate addresses
* Add methods to build and sign XO transactions and batches
* Add methods to submit XO transactions and batches
* Add form for user to create new game
* Add new game notification to UI and gameroomd
* Add player information displayed for a game in UI

  that handles special characters
* Add player information when updating an XO game from exported data (from state
  delta export)
* Add auto-generated protos for the UI
* Remove the explicit caching in the Gameroom Detail view in the UI, because Vue
  does this automatically
